- Practical Decision Making for robots
  - Is the door open
    - do i try to open it or find another way
- Agents
  - an entity that maps its perception of its environment to an action
  - P* percept history
- Good old fashioned AI
  - Sense
  - Model
  - Plan
  - ACT
  - acting is an "open loop"
- Behavior based / Reactive approach
  - subsumption architecture
    - claimed evolutionary model
    - direct link between sensing and acting
- Three layered architecture
  - control layer
  - sequencing layer
  - Deliberative layer
- Behavior layer
  - commonly Hierarchical Finite State Machine
  - Automata = State machine
    - states
    - transitions
  - Finite  = limited number of states
  - Hierarchical
    - states themselves can be HFSM
- Behavior System
  - may have multiple HFSM
  - state implements a Behavior
    - lightweight
    - discrete decisions
    - can preempt other operations
- State Execution
  - state machine is polled at given update rate
    - on_exit()
    - on_enter()
    - update()
- FSM Classifications
  - acceptors / recognizers
  - transducers
    - generate output based on a given input and / or a state using actions
    - moore machine
    - mealy machines
- ROS SMACH
  - Moore machines with data flow
- SMACH - State
  - interface basic robot capabilities / action
- SMACH Hierarchical State machines
