- Configuration
  - Specifying all points from robot to world
- Ideal Form controller tuning will be on the final
- LIDAR Principals of Operation
- LIDAR Resolution
  - linear resolution
  - angular resolution
    - uses divergence to its advantage
- Surface Reflectivity
  - Lambertian-type surfaces (most natural surfaces)
  - Specular-type surfaces
    - glass metal water etc
    - not detectable
- Example: Lidar on autonomous vehicle
- LIDAR beam to point clouds
  - need to keep in sync state estimate of vehicle with lidar data
  - treat each beam individually
- 3D Point Clouds
- OctoMapping
