- A* planning
  - expands all nodes with f < C
  - expands some nodes with f = C
- Anytime A*
  - if you inflate your heuristic you will not be worse than the degree that you inflated the heuristic
- State Lattice Path Planning
- Implicit (online) Construction of the Graph
  - each motion primitive represents a feasible trajectory
  - edges only added if they are collision free (in workspace)
- State Lattice Planning
  - pros
    - feasible paths
    - sparse graphs
    - can incorporate a variety of constraints
  - con
    - resolution issues
      - too few primitives may be incomplete
      - too many primitives may take too long
- Anytime repairing A*
  - anytime
    - at each update of planner
      - for decreasing weight on heuristic function
      -return best found path
- Finding Heuristics
  - Relaxation
  - Pattern Database
  - Max select
