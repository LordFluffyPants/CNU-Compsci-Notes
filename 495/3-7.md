- sources of error
  - Velocity vw = R y
    - y is uncertain
      - system uncertainty
      - sensor resolution
      - sensor measurement uncertainty
    - R is uncertain
      - inflation
      - compression
    - therefore V is uncertain
- Modeling Uncertainty: what is normal?
- Uncertainty is Stochastic Processes
- Stochastic Processes
  - R and Y are random variables
  - for diff drive, this leads to uncertainty
- Mapping
  - SLAM
    - State Localization Mapping
- 30,000' view of State Estimation
  - integration (dead reckoning)
- Benefits of Kalman Filtering
  - Improve noisy measurments (smoothing)
  - recursive
    - next estimate is using current estimate
  - State estimation (allows us to do feedback control)
