Q4 - 	A) there can be 16 simultanious connections because there are 4 links and each link can support 4 simultanious connections 
	 	B) there can be 8 simultanoious connections because now there are only 2 links and each link can support 4 simultanious connections
	 	C) Yes we can accomedate all 8 connections, 2 lines between each pair of switches dedicated to A and C and B and D
Q6 - 	A) M/S
	 	B) L/R
	 	C) M/S + L/R
	 	D) The last bit will be on the line because of the propagation delay
	 	E) The first bit will still be on the line because of the propagation delay is greater than the transmission time
	 	F) Its at B because the propagation delay is shorter than the transmission
	 	G) M = 535714.28571428571429
Q7  - 	The time it takes to construct a packet is 6.9ms the time to send it without prop delay is .224ms the propagation delay is 10ms so it is 			17.1ms delay
Q10 - 	(L/R1 + d1/s1) + (L/R2 + d2/s2) + (L/R3 + d3/s3) + 2dproc
		18 + 1/25 + .006 seconds = 18.046 seconds
