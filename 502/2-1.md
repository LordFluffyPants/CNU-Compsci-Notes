- TCP Ordering Packets
  - if the packets are out of order then the out of order packets are dropped and will not send acks back for them
- Homework 1 Overview
- TCP Congestion Control
- Why Congestion control
  - many connections share resources like router buffers, link bandwidth
  - if each computer sent data with maximum possible rate, network links would be overloaded
  - therefore send rates must be limited
  - fair sharing among active connections where each connection receives equal share of available resources
  - Approaches
    - end to end congestion control
    - network assisted congestion control
- TCP Congestion Control
  - sender limits the rate witch it can send out data
  - limit depends on perceived congestion in the network
  - congestion control algorithm based on congestion window
  - congestion window specifies amount of unacknowledged data a sender is not receiving
