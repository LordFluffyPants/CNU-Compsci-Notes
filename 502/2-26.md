- Network focuses on routes and forwarding
- Session "managing phone calls" of the internet (multiple connections, manage the data, manage the codex)
- Presentation (setting up multiple channels for display, mobile vs full version)
- Physical is the signal of the line
- Link is what you do on that line (error detection and correction, multiple access)
- Possible Services Provided by Link Layer
  - Framing
    - encapsulate network-layer datagrams
  - Link Access
    - specify the Medium Access Control MAC Protocol
  - Reliability Delivery
    - use mechanisms similar to the ones we learned about in transport layer; however most applied in case link has high bit-error rate; not typical for low-bit-error rates
  - Flow Control
    -avoid overload on receiver side
  - Error detection
    - detect bit errors, then drop frame
  - Error correction
    - fix the bit errors
  - Half-Duplex/ Full Duplex transmission
    - sending and receiving not possible/possible at the same time
- Link Communication
  - Network Interface Controller
- Error Detection and correction
  - parity bit used for low bit error rates
  - Error Detection and correction principle
    - error detection code part of the datagram header
  - methods
    - parity checks
      - checking even or odd number of ones
    - checksums
      - typical in IP
      - sum of all integers is calculated and sent with data
    - cyclic redundancy check
      - small fixed size checksum
      - interpret data bits as polynomials and do binary division
