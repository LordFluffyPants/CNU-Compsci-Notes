  - Events
    - ACK receipt for previously unacked data
    - ACK receipt for previously unacked data
    - Loss event detected by triple duplicate ACK

  - Commentary
    - Resulting in a doubling of CongWin every RTT
    - additive increase, resulting in increase of CongWin by 1 MSS every RTT
    - Fast recovery, implanting multiplicative decrease CongWin will not drop below 1 MSS
- Test will cover application and transport layer
