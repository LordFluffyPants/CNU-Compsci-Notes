- 802.11
  - BSS (best service set)
- 802.11 Channels and association
  - AP admin chooses frequency for AP (Access Point)
  - interference possible: channel can be same as that chosen by neighboring AP
  - Host must associate with an AP
    - scans channels, listening for beacon frames containing AP's name (SSID) and MAC address
    - selects AP to associate with
    - may perform authenticate
- Scanning for Access Point
  - Passive Scanning
  - Active Scanning
- 802.11 Multiple Access
  - avoid collisions  2+ nodes transmitting at same time
  - 802.11 CSMA - sense before transmitting
    - don't collide with ongoing transmission by other node
  - 802.11 no collision detection
    - difficult to receive (sense collisions) when transmitting due to weak received signals (fading)
- 802.11 MAC protocol
  - has ACKs to detect collisions
- Avoiding Collisions
  - idea: allow sender to "reserve" channel rather than random access of data frames
- 802.11 frame
  - address 1: MAC address of wireless host / receiving the frame
  - address 2: MAC address of wireless host / transmitting the frame
- Mobility in the same IP subnet
  - self learning: switch will see frame from H1 and "remember" which switch port can be used to reach H1
